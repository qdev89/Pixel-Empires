## Development

This is a vanilla JavaScript project with no external dependencies. All game logic is handled client-side for this initial version.

### Current Status

The project has completed four major development phases:
1. Core game mechanics with basic resource generation, buildings, and simple combat
2. Enhanced combat system with multiple unit types and strategic advantages
3. Research system with technology tree and bonuses
4. Advanced combat system with unit selection and visualization

Currently implementing visual enhancements and animations.

See the [Project Plan](project-plan.md) for detailed development phases and roadmap.

### Future Plans

- Complete visual enhancements and animations
- Server-side game state management
- Player vs Player combat
- Alliances and diplomacy
- Multiplayer features
- Advanced AI for more challenging NPC opponents
- Campaign mode with storyline
