## Current Status

The project is currently in Phase 8 (Enhanced Map Features), with the research system, enhanced combat system, animation system, diplomacy interface, and chat system completed. We have successfully implemented a comprehensive diplomacy system that allows players to establish relations with other factions, form alliances, and declare war. We've also added a multi-channel chat system with global, faction, and private messaging capabilities.

The current focus is on enhancing the map system with more terrain types, a fog of war system for unexplored areas, special locations and points of interest, and a more detailed minimap. These enhancements will make the game world more immersive and strategic for players.
